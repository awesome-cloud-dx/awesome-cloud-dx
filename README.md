# awesome-cloud-dx

This list is compiled from internal Notion pages we wrote at [Digger](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger). We used to consider nearly all of these products competition. Digger today is a completely different product (ci/cd orchestrator for Terraform) - so we aren't even on the list!

Most of the companies behind these products are early-stage startups; some descriptions might be out of date as their landing pages are updated frequently. Please submit PRs to fix!

# Simplified UX for your cloud account / Kubernetes
These products allow you to have a PaaS-like developer experience with your account at a major cloud provider like AWS, GCP or Azure without having to configure all the building blocks yourself. Think Heroku / Render / Railway kind of experience but powered by your cloud account.
